# Personalized Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of personalized automation scripts designed to save time and streamline repetitive tasks in penetration testing and ethical hacking workflows. These scripts help automate commonly used commands, tool setups, and routine processes so you can focus on the actual testing instead of repetitive manual input.

## Features

- Automate repetitive command-line tasks
- Simplify the use of common hacking and security tools
- Reduce human error by standardizing commands
- Easily extendable: add new scripts or modify existing ones for your workflow

## Scripts Overview

Each script is designed to handle a specific task. Examples include:

- Automating Nmap scans with predefined parameters
- Running common reconnaissance or enumeration commands
- Quickly executing multi-step tool workflows
- Generating reports or logging outputs automatically

*(Add your specific scripts and a short description of each here.)*

## Requirements

- Operating System: Linux (tested on Arch Linux, Ubuntu)
- Python 3.x (if your scripts are Python-based)
- Bash (if using shell scripts)
- Any dependencies for the tools you automate (e.g., Nmap, Hydra, Metasploit, etc.)

Testing if this works
